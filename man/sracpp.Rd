\title{Compute the sequential rank agreement between k ranked lists}
\usage{
sracpp(rankMat, maxlength, B, cens)
}
\arguments{
  \item{rankMat}{A matrix with k columns corresponding to
  the k ranked lists. Elements of each column are integers
  between 1 and the length of the lists}

  \item{maxlength}{The maximum depth that are needed XXX}

  \item{B}{The number of resamples to use in the presence
  of censored lists}

  \item{cens}{A vector of integer values that}
}
\value{
A vector of the same length as the rows in rankMat
containing the sequential rank agreement between the lists
for each depth
}
\description{
Computes the sequential rank agreement (number of items
present in all k lists divided by the current rank) for
each rank in the k lists
